# Employee-Management-System

## Building an Employee Management System

The purpose of this project is to create a database using MYSQL. The database is composed of three tables and they are: department, role, and employee. Developing this project demonstrates our back-end development skills using mysql, express js, and inquirer.
This project was developed with Inquirer version 8.2.4. Using Inquirer assisted in forming and structuring of our questions and responses. Along Inquirer, MySql was used for table creation and seeding. 

The following is an image of a newly generated table.
