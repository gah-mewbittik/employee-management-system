# Employee-Management-System

## Building an Employee Management System

The purpose of this project is to create a database using MYSQL. In the database, three tables are created and they are: department, role, and employee. Developing this project demonstrates our back-end development skills using mysql, Nodejs, and inquirer.
This project was developed with Inquirer version 8.2.4. Using Inquirer assisted in forming and structuring of our questions and responses. Along Inquirer, MySql was used for table creation, table seeding, and the management of data. 

The following is an image of the options a user has to use the application.
